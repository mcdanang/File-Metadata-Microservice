# File Metadata Microservice

Live on replit https://filemetadata-ms.mcdanang.repl.co

User stories:
1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name, file type, and size in bytes within the JSON response
